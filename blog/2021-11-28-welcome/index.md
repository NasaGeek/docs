**AskGit**, the command line tool for querying git repositories with SQL, is now called **MergeStat** (the command is now `mergestat`) and you can find our new home on GitHub at [`mergestat/mergestat`](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat) and our new homepage at [mergestat.com](https://mergestat.com/).

This is also the first post on our new blog and dedicated [documentation](https://docs.mergestat.com/) site, welcome! üéâ

## Why the change?
In short, to decenter *git* from our name.
*AskGit* has carried us a long way as a tool focused on querying the history and contents of git repositories, and that functionality remains a core part of what we're building.
However, as we look towards what's next, much of what we hope to make accesssible via our SQL environment is the ability to query ***software development in general***, not just git repositories.
That being said, git remains the backbone of so much of software development anyway, and as such, remains a key part of our project.

**MergeStat** is an allusion to our deep tie to git data (source code and commit history), but also is meant to convey the "bringing together" of a broader array of data sources we will be supporting.

## Join us on Slack
We're also launching a new dedicated [**Slack Community**](https://join.slack.com/t/mergestatcommunity/shared_invite/zt-xvvtvcz9-w3JJVIdhLgEWrVrKKNXOYg) - come hang out with us there - bring questions and any interesting queries!
